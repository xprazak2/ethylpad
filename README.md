The simplest and feature-poor clone of Etherpad, ever. Works together with [ethylpad_ui](https://github.com/xprazak2/ethylpad_ui).

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`
